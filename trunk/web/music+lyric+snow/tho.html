<p align="center"><u><font face="Arial">Snow Poem</font></u></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">When the white snow falls<br>
as if the sky was floating gently to the ground<br>
The cool air around me<br>
at winter time<br>
blows the snow around in various circles<br>
And the white ground looks as if painted<br>
everywhere around<br>
covered all about<br>
The children<br>
having snowball fights<br>
in the mist of nature's masterpiece<br>
Enjoying themselves<br>
on nature's wonderful time of year<br>
And some inside<br>
on an open fire<br>
roasting marshmellows<br>
'til they're brown and crisp<br>
And others still<br>
inside their homes<br>
decorating trees with shiny ornaments<br>
making nature's masterpiece<br>
even better than it was<br>
Christmas</font></p>
