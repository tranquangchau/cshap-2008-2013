<p><i>Many researchers have tried to put together classroom- or school-based models that
describe the teaching-learning process. A model is a visual aid or picture which
highlights the main ideas and variables in a process or a system. The models presented in
this paper include words or diagrams intended to give an understanding of the variables
associated with school learning, especially as measured by scores on standardized tests of
basic skills. The main models discussed and compared are by Carroll (1963), Proctor
(1984), Cruickshank (1985), Gage and Berliner (1992) and Huitt (1995).</i></p>

<p>Two major questions are addressed in educational psychology: (1) "Why do some 
students learn required knowledge and skills taught in school, while others do 
not?" (a criterion-referenced evaluation question) and (2) "Why do some students
learn more than other students?" (a norm-referenced evaluation question.) Unfortunately, the possible answers to these questions
are enormous. Oftentimes research findings and theories of teaching and learning seem to
contradict one another. What is an educator to do? </p>

<p>In this paper we will explore several models of teaching and learning. Gage &amp;
Berliner (1992) state that the use of models as learning aides have two primary benefits.
First, models provide "accurate and useful representations of knowledge that is
needed when solving problems in some particular domain" (p. 314). Second, a model
makes the process of understanding a domain of knowledge easier because it is a visual
expression of the topic. Gage and Berliner found that students who study models before a
lecture may recall as much as 57% more on questions concerning conceptual information than
students who receive instruction without the advantage of seeing and discussing models.
Alesandrini (1981) came to similar conclusions when he studied different pictorial-verbal
strategies for learning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research on the effectiveness of pictorial learning strategies indicates that learning
  is improved when pictures supplement verbal materials, when learners draw their own
  pictures while studying, and when learners are asked to generate mental pictures while
  reading or studying...the factor of sex was also included in the analysis due to its
  observed (although unexpected) effect (pp. 358, 363). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, the females in this study had a tendency to benefit more than males if
they related the specifics of their pictures to the whole concept. </p>

<p>Models have been used extensively in educational psychology to help clarify some of the
answers researchers have found that might shed light on such questions as, "How do
students learn effectively?" Or, "What is happening in this classroom that
facilitates learning better than in another classroom?"</p>

<p align="center"><b>John Carroll's Model</b></p>

<p>Most current models that categorize the variables or explanations of the many
influences on educational processes today stem from Carroll's (1963) seminal article
defining the major variables related to school learning. Carroll specialized in language
and learning, relating words and their meanings to the cognitive concepts and constructs
which they create (Klausmeier &amp; Goodwin, 1971). In his model, Carroll states that time
is the most important variable to school learning. A simple equation for Carroll's model
is:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>School Learning = f(time spent/time needed)</strong>.</p>

<p>Carroll explains that <strong>time spent</strong> is the result of <strong>opportunity</strong>
and <strong>perseverance</strong>. <strong>Opportunity</strong> in Carroll's model is
determined by the classroom teacher; the specific measure is called <strong>allotted</strong>
or <strong>allocated time</strong> (i.e., time allocated for learning by classroom
teachers.) <strong>Perseverance</strong> is the student's involvement with academic
content during that allocated time. Carroll proposed that perseverance be measured as the
percentage of the allocated time that students are actually involved in the learning
process and was labeled <strong>engagement rate</strong>. <strong>Allocated time
multiplied by engagement rate</strong> produced the variable Carroll proposed as a measure
of time spent, which came to be called <strong>engaged time</strong> or <strong>time-on-task</strong>.</p>

<p>Carroll (1963) proposed that the <strong>time needed</strong> by students to learn
academic content is contingent upon <strong>aptitude</strong> (the most often used measure
is IQ), <strong>ability to understand</strong> the instruction presented (the extent to
which they possessed <strong>prerequisite knowledge</strong>), and the <strong>quality of
instruction</strong> students receive in the process of learning. Carroll proposed that
these specific teacher and student behaviors and student characteristics where the only
variables needed to predict school learning; he did not include the influences of family,
community, society and the world that other authors discussed below have included.</p>

<p>The principles of this model can be seen in Bloom's (1976)
<a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/instruct/mastery.html">Mastery Learning model.</a> Bloom, a colleague of
Carroll's, observed that in traditional schooling a student's aptitude for learning
academic material (IQ) is one of the best predictor's of school achievement. His research
demonstrated that if time is not held constant for all learners (as it is in traditional
schooling) then a student's mastery of the prerequisite skills, rather than aptitude, is a
better predictor of school learning. Mastery Learning's basic principle is that almost all
students can earn A's if </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) students are given enough time to learn normal information taught in school, and <br>
  2) students are provided quality instruction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By quality instruction Bloom meant that teachers should: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) organize subject matter into manageable learning units, <br>
  (2) develop specific learning objectives for each unit, <br>
  (3) develop appropriate formative and summative assessment measures, and <br>
  (4) plan and implement group teaching strategies, with sufficient time allocations,
  practice opportunities, and corrective reinstruction for all students to reach the desired
  level of mastery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>Proctor's Model</b></p>

<p>Prior to the sixties the research on important school- and classroom-related variables
was directed toward the best traits or characteristics of teachers in an attempt to
identify good teaching and the important characteristics of schools and communities that
support good teaching. Proctor (1984) provides a model that updates this view by including
important teacher and student behaviors as predictors of student achievement. It is
derived from other teacher- and classroom-based models but is redesigned to emphasize
teacher expectations. Proctor states that it is possible for a self-fulfilling prophesy
(as researched by Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1968) to be an institutional phenomenon and
the climate of a school can have an effect on the achievement of its learners. The
attitudes, the norms, and the values of an educational faculty and staff can make a
difference in achievement test scores. The paradigm most influencing Proctor's model is
that of a social nature and not of a teacher/student one-on-one relationship. The other
models include the variables that provide the focus for this model, but show these
variables in a more subordinate manner.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/whuitt/col/images/proctor.jpg">
<img src="./A Review of Models of the Teaching Learning Process_files/proctor2.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="129"></a></p>

<p>Proctor's (1984) model begins with the factor of the <strong>School's Social Climate</strong>.
Some of the variables included in this would be attitudes, norms, beliefs, and prejudices.
This school climate is influenced by a number of factors, including such <strong>student
characteristics</strong> as race, gender, economic level, and past academic performance.</p>

<p>The student characteristics also influence <strong>teacher attitudes</strong> and <strong>teacher
efficacy</strong>. More recent studies support Proctor's (1984) position that student
self-image and behavior are affected by teacher efficacy (e.g., Ashton, 1984; Woolfolk
&amp; Hoy, 1990).</p>

<p>The next category of variables is the <strong>interaction</strong> among the
individuals involved in the schooling process. This includes the input of administrators
as well as that of teachers and students. If expectations of learning are high (i.e., the
school has good, qualified teachers and students who can learn) and there is high quality
instructional input, corrective feedback, and good communication among students, parents,
and educators, then the intermediate outcomes of student learning and student
self-expectation goes up. On the other hand, adverse or negative attitudes on the part of
instructors and administrators will cause student self-esteem, and consequently, student
achievement to spiral downwards.</p>

<p>The interactions in Proctor's (1984) model include the school's overall policy on
allowing time for children to learn or promoting other forms of student-based help when
needed. This could include <strong>quality of instruction</strong> (as in Carroll's (1963)
model above) or <strong>teacher classroom behaviors</strong> (as in Cruickshank's (1985)
model below). These behaviors have an effect on student classroom performance (especially
academic learning time and curriculum coverage) and self-expectations .</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>student's achievement level</strong> in Proctor's (1984) model is
an outcome of all previous factors and variables. It is hypothesized that there is a
cyclical relationship among the variables. In Proctor's model, the main concept is that
achievement in a specific classroom during a particular school year is not an end in
itself. It is refiltered into the social climate of the school image and the entire
process begins all over again. Proctor's model implies that change can be made at any
point along the way. These changes will affect school achievement, which will continue to
affect the social climate of the school.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Cruickshank's Model</b></p>

<p>The model by Cruickshank (1985) is more classroom- and teacher-based; he was heavily
influenced by models created by Mitzel, Biddle, and Flanders. Mitzel contributed the
concept of classifying variables as "product, process, or presage" (Cruickshank,
p. 17).<i> </i><strong>Product</strong> is learning on the part of the student (change in
behavior or behavior potential) while<i> </i><strong>process</strong> involves interaction
between student and teacher. <strong>Presage</strong> is the teacher's intelligence, level
of experience, success and other teacher characteristics. Presage is supposed to affect
process and then, of course, process will affect the product.</p>

<p>Biddle (as cited in Biddle &amp; Ellena, 1964) showed a relationship between specific
learning activities and teacher effects. In his model, Biddle offers seven categories of
variables related to schooling and student achievement: school and community contents,
formative experiences, classroom situations, teacher properties, teacher behaviors,
intermediate effects, and long-term consequences. This provides the foundation for
Cruickshank's (1985) model.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/images/biddle.jpg">
<img src="./A Review of Models of the Teaching Learning Process_files/biddle2.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="120"></a></p>

<p>Biddle also contributed a model of the transactional process of the classroom by
analyzing the structure and function of the communication process. This is reflected in
Cruickshank's model through the use of arrows depicting the interaction between teacher
and pupil classroom behavior.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/images/biddlec.jpg">
<img src="./A Review of Models of the Teaching Learning Process_files/biddlec2.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="120"></a></p>

<p>Biddle constructed his models to help answer questions he thought parents might ask,
such as: "How often does my child get individual attention from the teacher?"
Or, "Does the teacher really understand Junior's special problem?" (Adams &amp;
Biddle, 1970, p. 6). Biddle also helped define non-cognitive variables which contribute to
the affective domain (i.e., self-concept and self-esteem of the students). An example of
these variables would be teacher genuineness, "teacher-offered conditions of
respect...and modification of low self-concept" (Good, Biddle &amp; Brophy, 1975, p.
195).</p>

<p>Flanders (as cited in Cruickshank, 1985) offered the variables of teacher- and
student-classroom-talk and devised an instrument which focused on this behavior. "His
was the most frequently used instrument. It permitted observation of teachers' use of
'verbal influence,' defined as 'teacher talk' and 'pupil talk,' in a variety of classroom
situations" (Cruickshank, p. 17). Cruickshank put them all together and added
additional presage variables such as pupil characteristics, properties (abilities and
attitudes) and school, community and classroom climate.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Gage and Berliner's Model</b></p>

<p align="left">Gage and Berliner (1992) developed a model of the instructional process
that focuses on those variables that must be considered by the classroom teacher as she
designs and delivers instruction to students. This model attempts to define more precisely
what is meant by "quality instruction" and presents five tasks associated with
the instruction/learning process. The model is classroom- and teacher-based and centers
around the question, "What does a teacher do?"</p>

<p align="left">A teacher begins with <strong>objectives</strong> and ends with an <strong>evaluation</strong>.
<strong>Instruction</strong> connects objectives and evaluations and is based on the
teacher's knowledge of the <strong>students' characteristics</strong> and how best to
motivate them. If the evaluations do not demonstrate that the desired results have been
achieved, the teacher re-teaches the material and starts the process all over again.
Classroom management is subsumed under the rubric of motivating students. Gage and
Berliner suggest that the teacher should use research and principles from educational
psychology to develop proper teaching procedures to obtain optimal results.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Huitt's Model</b></p>

<p>The most recently developed model to be discussed (Huitt, 1995) identifies the major
categories of variables that have been related to school achievement. The model is not
only school-, classroom-, teacher-, and student-based, but includes additional contextual
influences as well. Huitt's model attempts to categorize and organize all the variables
that might be used to answer the question, "Why do some students learn more than
other students?" This is a revision of a model by Squires, Huitt and Segars (1983)
which focused only on those variables thought to be under the control of educators. This
earlier model focused on school- and classroom-level processes that predicted school
learning as measured on standardized tests of basic skills. One important addition in this
model is the redefinition of Academic Learning Time. It had long been recognized that
Carroll's conceptualization of time spent measured the quantity of time engaged in
academics, but was lacking in terms of the quality of that time. As discussed in Proctor's
(1984) model, Fisher and his colleagues (1978) had added the concept of success as an
important component of quality of time spent and coined the term Academic Learning Time
(ALT) which they defined as "engaged in academic learning at a high success
rate." Brady, Clinton, Sweeney, Peterson, &amp; Poynor (1977) added another quality
component--the extent to which content covered in the classroom overlaps to content
tested--which they called content overlap. Squires et al. used the more inclusive
definition of ALT proposed by Caldwell, Huitt &amp; Graeber (1982)--"the amount of
time students are successfully engaged on content that will be tested."</p>

<img src="./A Review of Models of the Teaching Learning Process_files/shs2.gif" border="0" width="100" height="83"></a></p>

<p>Huitt's (1995) model adds variables related to <strong>context</strong> and <strong>student
and teacher characteristics</strong>, some of which were the focus of the models by
Proctor (1984) and Cruickshank (1985). It is an interactive model along the lines of
Biddle and Ellena (1964), Cruickshank, and Laosa (1982).</p>

<p>Huitt advocates that important context variables must be considered because our society
is <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/papers/infoage.html">rapidly changing from an agricultural/industrial
base to an information base</a>. From this perspective, children are members of a
multi-faceted society, which influences and modifies the way they process learning as well
as defines the <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/student/desout.html">important knowledge and skills</a>
that must be acquired to be successful in that society. Huitt's model shows a relationship
among the categories of <strong>Context </strong>(family, home, school, and community
environments), <strong>Input</strong> (what students and teachers bring to the classroom
process), <strong>Classroom Processes</strong> (what is going on in the classroom),and <strong>Output</strong>
(measures of learning done outside of the classroom). These categories appear superimposed
in the model since it is proposed they are essentially intertwined in the learning
process.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/images/huitt.jpg">
<img src="./A Review of Models of the Teaching Learning Process_files/huitt2.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="117"></a></p>

<p>This model shows Input and Output as the beginning and end of the teaching/learning
process. Huitt (1995) believes that educators must first identify or propose an end result
(as stated by Gage &amp; Berliner, 1992) because how you identify and measure the end
product (Output) will influence the selection of important predictor variables (e.g., <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/papers/wymiwyg.html">What You Measure Is What You Get</a>, Hummel &amp; Huitt, 1994). Until
the outcome objectives are known, nothing else can be considered. Once outcome measures
are selected, educators can begin to focus on those variables that can explain fluctuation
or variability in those measures. Considering or changing specific goals or objectives may
change the predictor variables from each of the other three categories. Thus, the Output
or Outcome category is the most important and the focus of Huitt's model.</p>

<p>In the United States, the most often cited Output measures are scores on <strong>standardized
tests of basic skills</strong> such as reading, language arts, and mathematics as well as
science and social studies. Since the United States is ranked 14th out of 15 countries in
mathematics knowledge and 13th in science (Office of Policy and Planning, 1992), we need
to take a very close look at how we can improve achievement on these measures. For
example, the federal government focused on the task of increasing the Output measurements
of students when it adopted Goals 2000 (Swanson, 1991)<i>. </i></p>

<p>However, student achievement in basic skills is not the only desired outcome of
American education. The Secretary of Labor presented additional requirements in the report
by the <a href="http://www.academicinnovations.com/report.html">Secretary's Commission on
Achieving Necessary Skills</a> (SCANS; Whetzel, 1992). The SCANS report focuses on the
skills necessary for students to find work in the information economy. It addresses two
categories of skills: foundations (<strong>basic skills, thinking skills and personal
qualities</strong>) that provide the platform on which the other skills will be built and
competencies (<strong>handling resources, interpersonal skills, informational skills,
system skills, and technology utilization skills</strong>) that more closely describe what
workers will actually be doing. [Note: Huitt (1997) provides a <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/papers/scanspap.html">critique of the SCAN report</a> that addresses
important outcomes that were omitted.]</p>

<p>The most direct impact on important measures of school learning are those variables
related to <strong>Classroom Processes</strong>. This category includes two major
subcategories (<strong>Teacher Behavior</strong> and <strong>Student Behavior</strong>),
and an <strong>Other</strong> (or miscellaneous) subcategory that includes such variables
as classroom climate and student leadership roles.. </p>

<p>The category of Teacher Behavior includes the subcategories of <strong>planning</strong>
(getting ready for classroom interaction), <strong>management</strong> (getting the class
under control), and <strong>instruction</strong> (guiding the learning process). In
general, planning activities have little predictable relationship to student achievement
(Gage &amp; Berliner, 1992). Both management and instructional variables are moderately
related to achievement, but the lack of a strong relationship may be due to be a factor of
teacher inconsistency (Rosenshine &amp; Stevens, 1986). That is, teachers often change
their management and instructional practices based on the time of day or the
characteristics of a particular group of students. Three single variables, teachers
providing corrective feedback (e.g., give an explanation of what is correct or incorrect
and why), teachers' use of reinforcement, and level of student-teacher interaction (a
variable developed from the work of Flanders, as cited in Cruickshank, 1985) seem to be
the best single classroom predictors of student success (Rosenshine &amp; Stevens). Direct
or explicit instruction (Rosenshine, 1995) appears to be the best model of instruction
when scores on standardized tests of basic skills is used as the outcome measure.</p>

<p>Huitt supports Proctor's (1984) position that intermediate outcomes, or more
specifically <strong>Academic Learning Time</strong> (ALT) is one of the best Classroom
Process predictors of student achievement. As stated above ALT is defined as "the
amount of time students are successfully involved in the learning of content that will be
tested." There are three components to ALT and each is as important as the other. The
first is <strong>Content Overlap</strong>, defined as "the extent to which the
content objectives covered on the standardized test overlaps with the content objectives
covered in the classroom." This variable has also been labeled as
"time-on-target." The idea is simple: if an objective or topic is not taught, it
is not likely to be learned, and therefore we cannot expect students to do well on
measures of that content. In fact, to the extent the content is not specifically taught,
the test becomes an intelligence test rather than an achievement test. The fact that many
educators do not connect instructional objectives to specific objectives that will be
tested (Brady et al., 1977), is one reason that academic aptitude or IQ is such a good
predictor of scores on standardized tests. Both tests measure the same construct: the
amount of general knowledge an individual has obtained that is not necessarily taught in a
structured learning setting.</p>

<p>The second component of ALT is <strong>Student Involvement</strong>, defined the same
way that Carroll defined engaged time or time-on-task (allocated time X engagement rate).
If the students are not provided enough time to learn material or are not actively
involved while teachers are teaching they are not as likely to do well on measures of
school achievement at the end of the year. </p>

<p>The last element is that of <strong>Success</strong>, defined as "the percentage
of classwork that students complete with a high degree of accuracy." If a student is
not successful throughout the year on classroom academic tasks, that student will likely
not demonstrate success on the achievement measure at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Huitt proposes that these three components of Academic Learning Time should be
considered as the "vital signs" of a classroom. Just as a physician looks at
data regarding temperature, weight, and blood pressure before asking any further questions
or gathering any other data, supervisors need to look at the content overlap, involvement,
and success before collecting any other data or making suggestions about classroom
modifications. Classrooms where students are involved and making adequate progress on
important content are reasonably healthy and quite different from those classrooms where
students are not.</p>

<p>In addition to the teacher's classroom behavior, other time components such as the
number of days available for going to school (the <strong>school year</strong>), the
number of days the student actually attends school (<strong>attendance year</strong>), and
the number of hours the student has available to go to school each day (<strong>school day</strong>)
can influence ALT (<font size="3">Caldwell et al., 1982). </font>None of these additional
time variables were included in Carroll's (1963) model.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/images/timelev.jpg">
<img src="./A Review of Models of the Teaching Learning Process_files/timelv2.jpg" border="0" width="155" height="116"></a></p>

<p>What teachers and students do in the classroom will depend to some extent on the
characteristics or qualities they bring to the teaching/learning process. In Huitt's
(1995) model these are labeled <strong>Input</strong> variables. The subcategory of <strong>Teacher
Characteristics</strong> includes such variables as values and beliefs; knowledge of
students and the teaching/learning process; thinking, communication and performance
skills; and personality. While each of these is important to the classroom environment, <strong>teacher
efficacy</strong> is one of the best predictors of student success from this subcategory
(Proctor, 1984; Ashton, 1984). If a teacher believes that, in general, students can learn
the knowledge or skills, and that, specifically, he can teach them, then that teacher is
more likely to use the knowledge and skills he has and the students are more likely to
learn.</p>

<p>A second subcategory of Input is <strong>Student Characteristics</strong>. This
includes all of the descriptions of students that might have an influence on the
teaching/learning process and student outcome. Study Habits; Learning Style; Age;
Sex/Gender; Race/Ethnicity; Motivation; and Moral, Socioemotional, Cognitive, and
Character Development all become important in the relationship of classroom
processes/behavior and school achievement (Huitt, 1995). However, student aptitude and/or
prerequisite skills are probably the best student characteristic predictors (Bloom, 1976).
If time is held constant, then intelligence or ability to learn academic content will be a
better predictor than prior knowledge because the amount of content learned in the
classroom is allowed to vary. That is, if everyone has the same amount of time in which to
learn, then the speed at which one learns (aptitude) will be the best predictor of
achievement. However, if we vary the time students have to learn and keep the content to
be learned constant (such as in Mastery Learning), then prior knowledge is more salient.
Though we do not initially modify the student characteristics that each student brings to
the classroom, as Proctor (1984) pointed out the teacher can arrange the teaching/learning
process and modify each student's experience. This results in different Outcomes, which in
turn becomes the Input for the next learning cycle.</p>

<p>Finally, Huitt (1995) includes the category of <strong>Context</strong> that includes
such subcategories as <strong>School Processes and Characteristics, Family</strong>, <strong>Community</strong>,
<strong>State and Federal Government</strong>, <strong>TV/Movies</strong>, and the <strong>Global</strong>
<strong>Environment</strong>. For example, research shows that student achievement is
impacted by class size (e.g., Bracey, 1995) and school size (e.g., Fowler, 1995; Howley,
1996). While all of the variables in these subcategories are important and influence
variables in the other three major categories, probably the two most important are Family
and the Global Environment. Mother's education and family expectations for student
achievement have been shown to be excellent predictors of student achievement (e.g.,
Campbell, 1991; Voelkl, 1993; Zill, 1992) as well as the amount of technology in the home
(Perelman, 1992). Perhaps even more significant is the movement from the industrial age to
the information age (Perelman; Toffler &amp; Toffler, 1995). This is because it is
redefining the outcomes that ought to be the focus of schooling and is providing new
technologies that can radically alter the teaching/learning process.</p>

<p>An simple example of how some of these variables might interact is shown in the
following model. The size and region of the community combine with family characteristics
and processes to impact teacher and student characteristics. School and state policies
combine with teacher and student characteristics to impact teacher behavior, while student
characteristics and teacher behavior influence student behavior. Student classroom
behavior then influences teacher classroom behavior in an interactive pattern that
eventually results in student achievement as measured by instruments influenced by state
policies. Student achievement at the end of one school year then becomes a student
characteristic at the beginning of the next.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Summary and Conclusions</b></p>

<p>Each of the above models identifies important factors related to school learning and
contributes important information as we attempt to answer the question "Why do some
students learn more than others?" Over a period of years, the models have been
examined, reviewed, revised and edited to fit into today's modern society. Beginning with
Carroll (1963) and ending (at least as far as this review is concerned) with Huitt (1995),
we see teachers and school systems, families, communities and entire countries having an
influence on students' school learning. None of the variables appears to be so influential
that we need only pay attention to that particular factor in order to produce the kinds of
educational changes we desire. For example, an individual teacher could project his
self-fulfilling prophesies on a student (as seen in Cruickshank's 1985 model), but so also
could the institution itself (as seen in Proctor's 1984 model). Or the school may be
successful in developing students' basic skills, but students could still not be
successful in life because other important outcomes were not developed (Whetzel, 1992).</p>

<p>Understanding all the variables and the relationships among each other and to student
success may be more than we can expect of any educator. We may never fully grasp the
significance of the entire process, but we can make every effort to understand as much as
possible as we develop the teaching/learning processes appropriate for the information

<p>Models are useful tools to better understand not only the learning processes of

questions, but a careful study of the models can provide starting points to begin
developing more appropriate educational experiences for our society's next generation.</p>
