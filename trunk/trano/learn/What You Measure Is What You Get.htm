<p>The country's current focus on promoting critical thinking skills is our collective
reaction to a problem that has been developing for some time. Until recently we assumed
that critical thinking would automatically develop as students acquired knowledge and
primary importance was given to the discussion of specific disciplines to be studied. We
were able to ignore issues such as: What is critical thinking? How can it be measured? How
can it be promoted? until it became obvious that the level of critical thinking of too
many high school and college graduates was insufficient to the demands of modern society. </p>

<p>In order to effectively and efficiently accomplish the objective of improving students'
critical thinking abilities, we need to address the issues of defining and measuring
critical thinking. These must be done well before we can develop and test empirical
intervention strategies that will promote students' critical thinking skills in all
grades. </p>

<p>Critical thinking is probably the most current label for what many call analytical
reasoning, synthesis, problem-solving, or higher mental processes (Scriven &amp; Paul,
1992). Common threads that tie the various definitions of critical thinking together are
the terms used to describe the processes and outcomes associated with thinking critically,
the development of concepts and principles, the application of facts, concepts and
principles to solve problems and make decisions, and the evaluation of these solutions for
effectiveness (Chance, 1986; Ennis, 1987). Almost four decades ago, Bloom, Engelhart,
Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl (1956) published their now widely-accepted taxonomy for
classifying objectives and assessment items for the cognitive domain. Their system
specifies six levels of understanding and mastery, and each higher level subsumes the
properties of the lower levels. The levels of the taxonomy are, from lowest to highest,
knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Subsequent
research has lead to the conclusion that the taxonomy is indeed a hierarchy with the
exception that perhaps evaluation and synthesis are misplaced (Seddon, 1978). </p>

<p>Typically, students' achievement and critical thinking skills are assessed using a
forced-choice format. Unfortunately, most items used in these assessments address levels
of knowing and thinking not typically associated with critical thinking. Many researchers
(e.g., Carter, 1984; Gage and Berliner, 1992; Woolfolk, 1993) agree that the objective
test items used at all levels of education overwhelmingly tap the lower (i.e., knowledge
and comprehension) levels of the Bloom et al. (1956) taxonomy. Other researchers who
developed alternative taxonomies have drawn a similar conclusion (e.g., Stiggins, Rubel
&amp; Quellmalz, 1988). </p>

<p>These problems are crucial in that the types of assessments used in education affects
how students learn and how teachers teach (Fredericksen, 1984). This conclusion is so
central to teaching and assessment practices at all levels of education that in our
preservice and inservice teacher education classes we use the acronym WYMIWYG to emphasize
its importance. WYMIWYG specifies a concept we believe ought to be a guiding principle for
all educators: What You Measure Is What You Get. If educators develop assessments aimed at
higher-levels thinking skills, (a) they will be more likely to teach content at those
levels, and (b) students, according to Redfield and Rousseau (1982), will
master-and-perform at those levels. Students not only need to know an enormous amount of
facts, concepts, and principles, they also must be able to effectively think about this
knowledge in a variety of increasingly complex ways. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Getting Started </strong></p>

<p>We believe all educators can immediately begin improving students' abilities to think
critically by implementing a few basic strategies. First, teachers must insure that there
are instructional/behavioral objectives that cover the lesson's content. Care should be
taken to match objectives with an outside assessment, a next level of learning, or a
stated requirement for success in a given field or career (Wiggins, 1991). Objectives that
are too broad or general should be rewritten to specify what students should be able to do
after mastering the objective, and if teachers identify expected outcomes not covered in
existing objectives, new ones should be developed. After validating the congruence or
overlap between the objectives and content taught, educators should then analyze each
objective to determine its level vis-a-vis a validated taxonomy of the cognitive domain
(e.g., Bloom et al., 1956; Ebel, 1965; Gagne, 1985; Stiggins et al., 1988). If
appropriate, objectives should be rewritten to reflect a higher level of the taxonomy. (As
one rewrites objectives to require students to use critical thinking skills, one may also
have to revise the instructional techniques used to teach the course content.) Next, one
should evaluate the assessment instruments used to establish whether students have
mastered the content at the stated level of the taxonomy. If test items are used that only
require lower-level thinking skills such as knowledge and comprehension, students will not
develop and use their higher- order skills even if instructional methods that employ these
skills are implemented. This follows the maxim that individuals do not do what is
expected, only what is inspected. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Conclusions </strong></p>

<p>Convincing educators, including college teachers, to demand precise, operational
definitions of critical thinking is going to be no easy matter. In addition, getting
teachers and standardized test developers to assess students at the higher levels of the
taxonomy will not be an easy task. It takes time to prepare good assessments (e.g., tests,
demonstrations, exercises) that require students to think critically; it takes even longer
to prepare the necessary keys and to grade assessments such as essay exams and term
papers. Everyone is willing to say that good teaching and assessment (especially as they
relate to critical thinking) are important, but not enough educational resources are
committed to support and promote these activities. </p>

<p>Of course, simply having teachers give more essay-type or activity-oriented assignments
(even good ones that tap into the higher cognitive domains) will not necessarily improve
students' critical thinking skills. Likewise, outcomes assessment efforts, including
standardized tests, for high school or college graduates will not, by themselves, produce
improvements in students' critical thinking skills (though such assessments, if valid, may
help to emphasize and document the extent of the problem!). </p>

<p>Many teachers at all levels will likely need to be provided with inservice instruction
so they can (a) discover/rediscover the value of instructional techniques that include
well developed objectives and task analyses, and (b) incorporate new teaching strategies
(e.g., Gray, 1993; Hummel &amp; Rittenhouse, 1990) into their pedagogy that research shows
help to promote/develop the skills associated with critical thinking. Fortunately, a
variety of alternatives are becoming available (e.g., Georgia's Critical Thinking Skills
Program, 1993; Oxman, 1992). However, unless measurement of students' critical thinking
skills are completed regularly and given prominent attention by educators, the sustained
efforts required to make changes in our educational system are not likely to occur. </p>
